# Smart Parking Simulation

This project simulates an intelligent parking system using the **Mesa** library for agent-based modeling. It is designed as an educational tool for students and researchers interested in multi-agent systems, urban mobility, and intelligent infrastructure. 

## Utility for Different Stakeholders:

### 1. **Developers**
   - The project allows developers to get a clear simulation of how **drivers search for parking spaces** in a city. They can also use the **collected data** to analyze **which areas are more congested** and which parking spaces are most in demand.
   - **Web developers** can use this system to create applications that **optimize parking search** in cities, integrating it into mobile or web apps for **traffic resolution**.

### 2. **Local Authorities (City Hall)**
   - **City Hall** can use this system to understand **where congestion** is occurring in the city and which areas have the highest **traffic from drivers looking for parking**. 
   - This project also allows authorities to get data on **illegal parking** and implement **penalty strategies** to reduce congestion.
   - **Statistical data** generated by the **Statistician Agent** is very useful for making **informed decisions** about **where new parking spaces** should be created or **where existing infrastructure** needs improvement.


## Features

- Drivers search for and occupy available parking spots.
- Parking spots have limited capacities.
- A coordinator assigns drivers to the closest available spot.
- Police agents ensure that drivers are parked correctly.
- Interactive dashboard with a legend, grid visualization, and real-time charts.

## Installation

1. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r req.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

### 1. Graphical Interface (Web Dashboard)

To launch the interactive simulation:
```bash
python server.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8521
```

You can adjust the number of drivers and parking spots, and visualize the simulation live.

### 2. Console Mode (Without GUI)

To run a simple simulation in the terminal:
```bash
python run.py
```

This runs the simulation for 10 steps and prints the output in the console.

## Requirements

All dependencies are listed in the `req.txt` file.
